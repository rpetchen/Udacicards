This application allows a user to create, modify, and quiz themsleves on each deck of cards maintained by the application. Each deck can be further modified by adding cards which consist of one question and answer. The application will remind the user daily at 8PM if a quiz has not been taken for the day. The notification will reset and remind the user again the next day once a quiz has been taken.

This application has been tested solely on Android using Expo.
